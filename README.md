# Assignment
 I have designed two screens named user and userdetail
 In user screen i have implemented the api that you have given and showed the data using flatlist and navigate  to the userdetail screen and passed the id through params to userdetail screen
 In userdetail screen i have appended the id (that i am getting from the params) with the api url and implemented it and showed the  data  
 we can run this project through terminal by writing "npx react-native run-android/ios" or else we can run this using android studio and xcode as well
